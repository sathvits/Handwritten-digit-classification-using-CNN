# Handwritten-digit-classification-using-CNN

tThis can predict handwritten
digits from 0 to 9 where data set id directly imported from MNIST. As every
person has different style of writing digits humans can recognize easily but for computer it is
comparatively a difficult task so here neural network approach is used where in the machine
will learn on itself by gaining experiences and the accuracy will increase based upon the
experience it gains. The dataset was trained using convolutional neural network algorithm. The overall
system accuracy obtained was 83.3%. As human vision is one of the wonders of the world.
Humans carry a super computer in head where humans can sense the world or can see the
world through evolution of over hundreds and millions of neurons hence handwritten digit
recognition isn’t an easy task for machines. Every human has its own way of writing numbers
therefore for a machine it becomes difficult to predict digits. Similarly they also have their own
tendency of recognizing a digit for example let’s take ‘9’ one can remember it as it has a loop
and a stroke thus here in case of machine training set is provided. Here, Neural Network
approach is used where several hand written digit examples are given where the system can
learn from those examples and predict exactly what the digit is. If the number of training
examples is increased accuracy will be further increased.
